And it’s made with React, of course.",

It’s a story about ambitious space programmes, alien contact, and a time when world powers had a far more overt animosity for each other. It’s also very, very pulpy. For this project I wanted to capture some of the scrappy spirit of old pulp comics, and challenge myself to finishing the project within a week. Done, and 16 pages long!",
