# gwil-react-portfolio
A little CV / Portfolio webpage built with React.

This portfolio is a single page React app made using Webpack, ES6 and Sass. There’s a few fun things in here: a simple carousel component; an image scaling component (scaling from the image’s dimensions rather than its element’s — good if you want to display retina assets for arbitrary image sizes!); the rest are just dumb components and a bit of Sass.
